-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   THE FLASK FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION
 learn how to use Python for the web.
using a Python web framework called Flask.

what a framework is and how it differs from a regular installable package.

-when you install a package, it plugs into the code that you've already written.
You can use as much or as little of that package's functionality as you need.

- A framework, however, inverts that control.
In a framework, most of the code is already written, and you have to plug your code into it.
-provide the framework, the structure, and allow us to create powerful web applications quickly, but still customized to our individual needs.

The Flask framework is a web-based framework using Python

one of the most popular and widely supported frameworks within the Python community.
 is what's known as a micro-framework.
It allows us to get up and running building websites with minimal Python code.
We often say with micro-frameworks however, that batteries aren't included, which means that we don't get a lot of features out of the box, like we would with a larger framework such as Django for instance.
Flask doesn't come with a default database engine, but the appeal of it, is its simplicity.
There are also many extensions we could install that provide the functionality of the larger frameworks.

going to use Flask throughout this lesson to run a Python server-side project.
We will serve HTML files from our server, and we'll use the Jinja templating language to write logic inside of our HTML templates, which allows us to use Python for-loops, if-statements, and also inheritance.
We'll also learn how to submit forms, which will allow us to take data from the client and display it on the server.

The learning outcomes for this lesson include:
Creating and running a Flask application.
Serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the backend.
How to make our code reusable by using template logic.
How to post data from HTML forms.
And how to deploy our project using a platform called Heroku so that it's served externally for all the world to see.
